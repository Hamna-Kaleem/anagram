# Anagram Game ðŸ’¥
So, I created this game... not because I had a grand vision or anything. Nope. It was just one of those "Iâ€™m bored, letâ€™s make something" moments. You know, when you have free time, a laptop, and a lot of caffeine. And thus, the Anagram Game was created!


Itâ€™s a simple game where you get to guess words from jumbled letters â€” but with a twist! It's fast, fun, and endless (unless you decide to stop, of course). And guess what? It even reshuffles! Because, why not?


Whether youâ€™re learning English, sharpening your brain, or just wasting time like me â€” this game is for you!

**Features**

**Endless rounds:** Keep going until you hit that stop button (or until your fingers give up).

**Reshuffle:** Change the jumbled letters anytime you want â€” itâ€™s like the game has a mind of its own.

**Simple words:** Just a mix of intermediate and simple words â€” so no one feels left behind. ðŸŽ‰

**Stop button:** Because sometimes, you need to stop and breathe. ðŸ›‘

**How to Play**
The game shows you a jumbled word.

You type in your guess.

If you get it right, it shows the next word!

If you get it wrong, it gives you a hint and allows you to keep trying. (Weâ€™re all about second chances here.)

When youâ€™re done, just hit the stop button and enjoy your free time again.

**Built With**

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript (because whatâ€™s a game without it?)

**Why did I make this?**

Honestly, I was just free one afternoon, and I wanted to learn something new. And here we are. So if youâ€™re wondering why I didnâ€™t make something super fancy â€” well, now you know. But hey, it works, right?
